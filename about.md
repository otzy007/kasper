Who am I?
---------
A Ruby on Rails and RubyMotion Developer and a Linux Geek ðŸ˜œ

Most of the time I write Ruby code but I'm not scared of trying new languages or
technologies that help me do the work better.

You can see a part of my work on this website and on Github at: https://github.com/otzy007
